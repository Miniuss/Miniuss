# Hello world!
Hi there! I am Minius, a beginner developer. I've begun learning coding approximately in **year 2022**, and planning to improve in this sphere as much as I can.

## Programming languages I know 💻
I know plenty of the programming languages, this includes:

- Python
- Lua
- SQL (partially)
- JavaScript

While these are technically not programming languages, I will also include just for clarification knowledge of:

- HTML
- CSS

## My qualities 🏅
While as a beginner I don't really have that much of redeeming qualities, I try to improve myself.

Here's list of some that I currently have:

- ### Constant race for improvement
    - I always try to impove myself wherever and whenever I can. I take any advise that can help me and respect constructive criticism.
- ### Always trying to write beatiful, readable code
    - I try to avoid possibility of confusion in functionality of my code, always try to make it look presentable and readable.

## Plans for future 📝
As stated earlier, I have big plans for future to improve my coding skills.

List of what i want to do in future:
