# About me

My hobby in programming bounds is to **make small applications that solve minor problems**, as for instance my [Discord timestamping applicaiton](https://github.com/Miniuss/DiscordTimestamper).\
I love to make games sometimes.\
I can make sometimes bigger projects, though I don't really have the biggest motivation to make them.\
